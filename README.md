# Covid-19 EDA focused on visualization
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis of industry and consumption trends during Post-Covid era in South Korea

The purpose of our analysis is to visualize the economic shock of Covid-19 and ultimately to provide meaningful insights for industry forecast under the unprecedented pandemic era. Thus, it is important to look into not only the consumption trend in industry but the recovery speed of industry. To compute the impact in each industry, we introduce two indices as below.

* Risk Index: Indication of how "much" the consumption of one industry has increased/decreased in the *expansion* period
* Resilience Index: Indication of how "fast" the consumption of one industry has increased/decreased in the *stable* period
